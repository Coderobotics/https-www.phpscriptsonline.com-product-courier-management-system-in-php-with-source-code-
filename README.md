# Courier Management PHP Script
The Courier Office Management PHP software is developed in PHP with a MySQL database that helps a courier company or businesses manage their customers’ parcels or package details. The system has multi branch features that can be also used when setting a destination where the recipient will pick up their packages or parcels. The Courier Management PHP Project has a tracking feature where it can help to monitor the movement of the customer’s parcel. The system has 2 types of user which is the Admin user and the Branch Staff user. The Admin user can manage all the data in the system including managing the branches and branches staff user. The Courier Management PHP Script has options to track all the status about the package. The Branch user can only track a parcel and manage the list of parcels where the origin or the destination of a parcel under the logged-in staff branch. The system admin or staff user can store or add multiple items at the same time but these items will be stored in the database separately because each package has a different reference number or different tracking number.
